# Snake-Game

This hungry serpent is looking for some food to eat, and the more it eats the more it grows!
We must help this gluttonous snake eat more, so it can grow and become the longest serpent this world has ever seen!

MVP
-render a start screen with game-play instructions
-display the container with a small box for food and a small snake
-create the snake and be able to move it around using WASD keys
-Have the snake grow each time he eats the food
-populate more food after the snake eat it
-create a GAME OVER! text to populate over the screen once the snake bites the end of its tail

STRETCH GOALS
-create different levels of intensity by increasing the speed of the snake
-have more than one snake
-have blocks (or obstacles) that do not allow the snake to pass through, making it more difficult for the player
-create poisonous food that would kill the snake![89F9AF4E-E62B-4D32-841E-05EFA6FC2E0C](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/117884014/205125702-de139a0e-ec23-4f02-bd7d-f6737e2b088f.jpeg)
